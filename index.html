          </header>
          <ul>
            <li>UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on a residence basis increased by 3% to just over 502 million tonnes
              of carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt Co2e) between 2020 and 2021.</li>

            <li>The impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on emissions would likely have been weaker than in
              2020 because of fewer UK pandemic restrictions in 2021.</li>

            <li>Consumer expenditure is still the largest single UK emissions contributor, at 26% of the 2021 total; the
              energy sector was second highest at 17%.</li>

            <li>Energy from renewable sources accounted for 13% of total UK energy use in 2021, decreasing slightly from
              14% in 2020.</li>

            <li>Output from the UK environmental goods and services sector (EGSS) was estimated to be £89.6 billion in
              2020, up 1.5% from 2019.</li>

            <li>Employment in the UK EGSS was estimated to be 398,800 full-time equivalent employees in 2020, up 2.2%
              from 2019.</li>

            <h2>2. Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h2> <!-- narrative again copied from ONS page-->
          </header>
          <p>Total UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (residence basis) in 2021 were just over 502 million tonnes of
            carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt Co2e). Information about the different method used to measure emissions can be
            found in the Measuring UK greenhouse gas emissions article, available on the UK climate change statistics
            Portal.</p>

          <p>The transport sector’s emissions reduced by 9% in 2021 following a 28% fall in 2020; the largest decrease
            (34%) of all sectors since 2019.</p>

          <p>Emissions from households, accounted for through consumer expenditure, are the largest single contributor
            to UK emissions. In 2021, emissions related to consumer expenditure – primarily from heating homes and
            travelling – rose 7% to 135 Mt Co2e in 2021, 26% of the total. The second highest emitter was the energy
            sector, rising 7% to reach 86 Mt Co2e, 17% of the total.</p>

          </header>
          <p>A reduction in overall UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity would, in theory, indicate that the UK is
            moving towards a lower carbon economy.</p>

          <p>In 2021, the UK emitted 0.19 thousand tonnes of Co2e per £ million of gross value added (GVA). This is a
            drop
            of 67% since 1990.</p>

          <p>Agriculture, forestry and fishing was by far the most emission intensive industry in 2021 after surpassing
            electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply in 2016. This is likely a combination of the agriculture
            industry being the heaviest emitter of the potent GHG CH4 (Methane) and the reduction in emission intensity
            from the electricity industry.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Greenhouse gas emissions intensity is calculated by dividing the level of greenhouse gas emissions
                by gross
                value added (GVA). GVA is the difference between output and intermediate consumption for any given
                industry.
                This means the difference between the value of goods and services produced (output) and the cost of
                raw
                materials and other inputs that are used up in production (intermediate consumption). GVA are chained
                volume
                measures, in constant prices with 2019 as the base year. All emissions intensity figures are
                calculated
                excluding consumer expenditure (often referred to as “households” in the article accompanying this
                dataset).

              </li>
              <li>As part of Blue Book 2022, the 2020 data went through the supply use balancing process where output
                and
                intermediate consumption are accurately measured.</li>

            <h2>4. Energy Use</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Most greenhouse gas emissions are related to energy use. The UK used a total of almost 176 million tonnes
            of
            oil equivalent (Mtoe) of energy in 2021, with 80% coming from fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>In 2021, energy from renewable sources accounted for 13% of all energy use in the UK, compared with 0.9% in
            1990. Energy use from fossil fuels has been falling for the energy and manufacturing sectors, largely
            because
            of a switch from the use of coal to other fuels, such as natural gas, which generate lower emissions.</p>

          <h3>Figure 3: The four sectors that contribute the most air emissions also use the most energy from fossil
            fuels</h3>
